Teze is a top notch Javavore who loves pushing code. teze is a nine-to-fiver who works best in the evening (around 6 pm).

teze's developer personality is very similar to Jeff Kolesky's but Jeff is less of a Java aficionado. There is also an uncanny similarity between teze's activity stream and those of Artem Eroshenko, GitHub Sample Student, artkoshelev, and Carlos Vásquez Polanco.

It seems like teze is—or should be—friends with Jake Wharton. With this in mind, it's worth noting that Jake is more of a Groovy aficionado. There is also an obvious connection between teze and mcxiaoke, youxiachai, Yahya Bayramoğlu, and Alex.Chen.

These days, teze is most actively contributing to the repositories: teze/teze.github.io, and teze/MyApplicationProject.
